# Club Theranos Application
Club Theranos is a fun application that allows visitors to read gossip posted by registered Theranos users. Unregistered users can only
anonymous postings. Registered users can see the posting and the user who posted it. This project is solely for entertainment purposes
and is based on the members-only project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) as well as my fascination with the craziness of Theranos from the book "Bad Blood".
